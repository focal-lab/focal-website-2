I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Davis, and a CITRIS intern at the FOCAL Lab for the summer of 2025. I have historically applied much of my machine learning and software development abilities to open source projects in the realm of biomedical engineering and pedagogical research. I have always been passionate about climate change and forest perservation, and this lab has presented me with a great opportunity to apply my expertise in data reduction methods and hyperparameter optimization to meaningful work that I am excited to be a part of.
