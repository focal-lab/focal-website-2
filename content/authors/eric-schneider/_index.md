I am interested in applying concepts from computer vision, robotics, data science, and machine learning to make useful tools for ecological research. I am supporting internal projects in the FOCAL Lab as well as the [Open Forest Observatory](https://openforestobservatory.org/) for a 3-month work project. OFO is building on a strong open-source set of tools, and I am excited to both learn more about the problems OFO faces and make progress on the projects they find most critical!
