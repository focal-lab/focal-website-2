# Position summary
The FOCAL Lab at UC Davis is recruiting an undergraduate Open-Source Software Engineering Intern to contribute to the lab’s work at the intersection of forest ecology, forest mapping, and forest management. The intern will learn about and contribute to the development of open source tools for processing drone imagery and other types of data to answer ecological questions. Specifically, the intern will be responsible for improving the code quality of several existing open source repositories such as [automate-metashape](https://github.com/open-forest-observatory/automate-metashape), for automating a 3D model creation workflow from drone images, and the [multiview-mapping-toolkit](https://github.com/open-forest-observatory/multiview-mapping-toolkit), for generating predictions about the landscape with 3D models and the raw images used to create them. 

A strong background in software engineering is required. A specific focus on open source development and creating easy-to-use tools is desirable. An understanding of the technical concepts underlying domain-specific software may be helpful, but more important is an ability to learn and interpret the documentation for these libraries. Members of communities traditionally underrepresented in software engineering or ecology are strongly encouraged to apply. 

# Hours, dates, and work location
The preferred start date is in January 2024. The position will extend through at least May 2024, with an option for extension into the summer and beyond based on funding and performance. There will be 5-10 hours of work per week, as dictated by the intern’s availability. The position may be remote or in person (office on the UC Davis campus) depending on preference.

# Compensation
Approximately $18.50 / hour.

# Primary duties
* Improve the quality of existing codebases by reorganizing, modularizing, documenting, and streamlining.
* Document problems through github issues and respond to issues created by the supervisor and the community.
* Propose and discuss improvements to efficiency or user experience.
* Improve project-level documentation and example code.
* The intern will receive mentoring on general software development principles as well as feedback on their code through code reviews and meetings.

# Minimum qualifications
* Undergraduate student in software engineering, computer science, data science, or related field OR another field with demonstrated understanding of software engineering fundamentals
* Experience with Python
* Experience with version control such as git
* Desire to create easy-to-use tools for ecologists

# Desired qualifications (these are a plus but not required)
* Experience with open source or multi-contributor git concepts such as branching, merging, pull requests, and code review
* Experience with R
* Familiarity using Linux and/or working in remote/cloud-based environments
* Understanding of dependency management and software packaging
* Conceptual understanding of or experience with software for any of the following:
  * Geospatial information processing
  * Optimizing workflows for large dataset processing
  * Parallel or GPU computing
  * Computer vision or image processing
  * Fundamental machine learning concepts such as clustering, classification, or regression
* Experience interfacing with non-computing domain specialists (e.g. ecologists)

# To apply
* Please submit a cover letter (including your interest in the position, relevant experience, and availability dates), CV/resume, and contact information for three references (including name, organization, email, and relationship to you). Combine this information into a single PDF and email it to David Russell, [djrussell@ucdavis.edu](mailto:djrussell@ucdavis.edu), with the the subject line "Open-Source Software Engineering Intern Application".
* The position will remain open until filled. For full consideration, apply by December 22nd, 2023.
* Applicants who apply before the 22nd will be notified whether they have been selected for an interview by December 29th, 2023.
