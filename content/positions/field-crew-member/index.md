## Employment period

June 18 to September 17 2025 (minimum), with potential for extension to assist with data management and processing

 ## Compensation

Approximately $18.50/hour.

## Eligibility

This position is for current UC students (any UC campus) or spring 2025 UC graduates.

## Field location

Mountains of Northern California (primarily the Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascades)

## Office location (duty station)

Davis, CA (UC Davis)

## Job purpose

Serve on a three- or four-member field crew supporting a study aiming to better understand post-fire
recovery processes in the forests of northern California. Collected data will also be used to
validate the use of drone imagery for forest mapping. The fieldwork will occur across multiple
recently burned forest areas, as well as unburned forests, and will provide an opportunity to
experience a diversity of California mountain landscapes and vegetation conditions. The work
involves surveying regenerating vegetation (e.g., tree seedlings) and overstory canopy condition.
Most plot surveys will consist of revisits of plots established and surveyed in previous years.

The fieldwork will occur primarily across the footprints of fires that burned in 2020 and 2021 in
northern California (Sierra, Eldorado, Plumas, and Lassen National Forests), with potential for
additional work elsewhere in the Southern Cascades as well as in the North
Coast Range (Mendocino and Shasta-Trinity National Forests).
## Job description

The crew member is responsible for conducting field sampling. The crew member will be responsible for the following:

- **Field data collection (90%):** Collect field data, including data on regenerating vegetation. Drive to and between field sites; navigate to sites on remote roads; locate remote field sites using mobile devices, topographic maps, compass.

- **Data and equipment management (10%):** Ensure that equipment and data are managed properly; perform data entry at an office location.

## Work location

The duty station will be in Davis, CA. During the work week, crews will primarily be car camping near the project study sites on National Forests. Camping will usually be “dispersed camping” (undeveloped areas that are adjacent to remote roads and have no facilities) but will occasionally be in campsites (with campsite fees paid by employer). Camping location will change frequently as the crew moves to different study areas.

## Work schedule

The work schedule will primarily consist of eight 10-hour days, beginning and ending on Wednesdays, followed by six days off, with the potential for some hitches consisting of four 10-hour days followed by 3 days off. The supervisor will attempt to accommodate the scheduling preferences of the crew, but crew members must be flexible with respect to the work schedule. During fire season, smoke and fire hazard may necessitate rapid adjustments to work location or schedule (e.g., shifting departure and/or return dates to avoid hazardous weather conditions). In the event of extended periods of fire or smoke hazards that preclude fieldwork, the supervisor will attempt to arrange office work, but continuous full-time work during peak fire season cannot be guaranteed.

## Transportation

Field campaigns will begin and end at the duty station in Davis, CA.

The crew will be provided a vehicle. Ability and willingness to contribute to the driving duties will be viewed favorably. Travel to field sites will require highway driving as well as driving on rough, remote, poorly-signed backcountry roads.

## Equipment and gear

All necessary field equipment will be provided. Communal camping gear (e.g., water jugs and cooking
gear) will also be provided. The crew members will be responsible for their own personal camping
gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad) and field clothing.

## Training

Training in field methods, equipment, and safety will be provided. Valid wilderness first aid (or more advanced) certification, or willingness to complete training prior to the start of the field season, is required (registration costs will be covered by the employer).

## Work conditions/physical demands

Crew members must be in very good physical condition. Field conditions will usually be hot with little
shade, but can also be very cold and potentially wet. Work will require hiking up to 8 miles per day
(though usually much less) with a heavy pack through sometimes difficult and steep terrain, usually
without trails, usually in areas burned by wildfire, and often with dense and/or thorny shrub cover.
Field plots will also often be covered by thick shrubs, sometimes over head height, and
often with sharp thorns, and which can make movement slow and difficult. Comfort working under these conditions is essential! Work will involve
camping, often with no facilities (see Work location, above). Work requires careful, legible
handwriting and careful attention to detail.

## Minimum qualifications

- Progress toward a bachelor's degree in ecology, natural resource management, or related natural science field
- Experience in scientific data collection through coursework and/or job experience
- Comfort with and ability to maintain a positive attitude in physically demanding and/or uncomfortable conditions (see Work conditions/physical demands, above)
- Experience camping in remote locations with no facilities
- CPR and Wilderness First Aid certified (certification may be accomplished after job offer is made, with registration cost paid by the employer)

## Preferred qualifications

- Skilled in identifying California trees and shrubs
- Experience working with complex data recording equipment
- Valid driver’s license; willingness to share driving responsibilities
- Experience operating a vehicle on rough, remote roads

## Application due date

Review of applications will begin on January 24, 2025. Apply by this date for full consideration.
